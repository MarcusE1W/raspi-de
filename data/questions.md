- How are the linked in etc links actually used

- how to see the about text (it seems to be on the flipped page but behind the flipped tiles.``

- is there a way to add more default pictures that get assigned randomly if no cover picture is assigned?

- Is it possibel to get rid of the autors name on the article sumary in the front page? If I leave `author` free in the front matter I still get the `@` symbol.

- When you flip the page the top left corner button is visible but does nothing. To flip back you use the top right corner button. Can the top left one be turned off while flipped ?
